# Ozone S3 - Spark - CML Blog

In this demo, we downloaded covid-19 data from https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv as our data source and store the data in Ozone as data.csv file. Please note that the data in data.csv may not reflect the latest version of the original data sources.
